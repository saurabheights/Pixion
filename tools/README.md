## Hue-Picker

This tool analyzes HSV channels of an image/video/webcam and allows for quick lower and upper bound thresholding of colors to see if 
ROI (region of interest) can be seperated from background. 

For Webcam input:

```bash
hue-picker
```

For an image input:

```bash
hue-picker path/to/image.jpg
```
